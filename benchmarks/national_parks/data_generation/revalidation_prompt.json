Do not invent details not evidenced in the conversation or tool results.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response MUST be ONLY valid JSON with NO markdown, NO comments, and NO extra text. The output must be directly parsable by Python's json.loads().\n\nThe required JSON structure is:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Updated task name (if needed)\",\n  \"description\": \"Updated task description with actual details used\",\n  \"goal\": \"Updated goal (if needed)\"\n}"
